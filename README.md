# Warp Radial
[Warp Radial](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/warp-radial) is inspired by older versions of FTB-Utilities where you could add warp points and there were this really nice radial menu to select the warp point to teleport to.  
This is my take on a radial menu for this exact purpose.

Only OPs can add server warp points.  
There are two ways to add warp points, either through the radial menu or through commands.  
The following commands can be use to add and remove warp points.
- warpradial home set
- warpradial home remove
- warpradial warp add warp1
- warpradial warp remove warp1
- warpradial serverwarp warp1 (Ops only)
- warpradial serverwarp warp1 (Ops only)

The base command warpradial can be replaced by wr in all commands.

This mod requires [BML](https://github.com/Crimix/bml) as the base radial menu api is implemented in that library mod.
